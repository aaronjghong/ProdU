# CS50X FINAL PROJECT
This is my final project for CS50X

The project will be a web-app built with Flask

The app will be a life-style productivity app where users can manage
projects (in the form of to-do lists) and plans/appointments they have made

Projects are planned to allow multiple users to access it while plans/appointments will stay private to each user

## What's done:
- Registration
- Logins
- Changing passwords
- Plans / Appointments
- Basic Projects Page

## What needs to be done:
- Projects
- - Sharing projects
- - Making a new shared projects table and adding shared project ids to that table
- - Project comments / Project item comments
- Design
