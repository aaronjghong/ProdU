# CS50X FINAL PROJECT
This is my final project for CS50X

The project will be a web-app built with Flask

The app will be a life-style productivity app where users can manage
projects (in the form of to-do lists) and plans/appointments they have made

Projects are planned to allow multiple users to access it while plans/appointments will stay private to each user
